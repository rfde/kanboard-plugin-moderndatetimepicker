Modern DateTime Picker
==============================

This plugin replaces the jQuery UI datetime picker by the excellent **flatpickr** ([Github](https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr), [Website](https://flatpickr.js.org/)).

I find flatpickr easier to use: its accessible from the keyboard and falls back to native controls in mobile browsers. Here are some impressions:

*In Firefox on Linux:*

*In Chrome on Android (on a German OS, so the native control is in German):*

Please note that I only wrote the Kanboard integration. The main work definitely lies with the flatpickr developers. If you like their control, consider [supporting them](https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr#supporting-flatpickr).
